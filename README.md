# windowKDEdetector

Here, we propose an online and unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm for streaming data using an array of sliding windows and the probability density-based descriptors (based on these windows). This algorithm mainly consists of three steps:  First, we use a main sliding window over streaming data and segment this window into an array of non-overlapping sub-windows; then, we propose our probability density-based descriptors with dimension reduction, based on kernel density estimation, to estimate the probability density of data in each sub-window; finally, we design the distance-based anomaly detection rule to determine whether the current observation is anomalous. Experimental results and performances are presented based on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark. Compared with the anomaly detection algorithm using Hierarchical Temporal Memory proposed by Numenta (which outperforms a wide range of other anomaly detection algorithms), our algorithm can perform better in many cases, i.e., with higher detection rates and earlier detection for contextual anomalies and concept drifts.

1. The code file "WindowKDE_detector.py" should run on the platform called Numnta Anomaly Benchmark, whose detailed installation requirements can be seen in: https://github.com/numenta/NAB.

2. The data files have been experimented using our algorithm and readers can actually try the same values we set on the same datasets.
